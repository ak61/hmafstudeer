### Wat RFID is:

* RFID doesn’t need line of sight
* RFID tags are able to be rewritten and reused
* RFID tags can be extremely durable against impact and environmental factors
* RFID tag data is encrypted and can also be locked for extra security
* RFID tags can hold more data than other types of tags or labels
* RFID readers can read hundreds of tags within seconds
* RFID tags can have information printed on them like instructions, barcodes, or company names
* RFID systems can be integrated with other internal systems or processes

### **What RFID Isn’t**

* RFID technology isn’t an all-knowing, all-seeing, limitless technology.
* RFID tags do not store immense amounts of data – most are designed to hold a number for identification. While some tags can store more data in the user memory section, accessing that additional data slows down read time.
* RFID tags can’t be read from everywhere. Most UHF RFID tags, on average, can only read 14 – 20 feet depending on the frequency and size. The tags used in large outdoor applications CAN be read from up to 500 feet, but they are active RFID tags \(which means they contain batteries and on average only live 3-5 years\) and are pretty big – typically larger, heavier, and a good deal more expensive than passive tags.
* An RFID system isn’t cheap – most systems average in cost from a few hundred dollars for a small reader/writer and a few tags to over several thousands of dollars for a single read zone with a reader, a few antennas, and tags.
* RFID tags are not insecure or unprotected – most tags come with a [security protocol](http://blog.atlasrfidstore.com/uhf-rfid-security-measures) that can be enhanced with software or the tag can be locked from being read with a passcode.
* Just like you can’t track down your “chipped” animal when it is lost \(LF RFID\), you can’t track tagged objects unless there is RFID hardware in the read area. If hardware is setup throughout a building, you can track a tagged object in the building, even \(with the correct setup\) identifying the room in which it is located. But, once the object leaves the building and the read area, the tag is no longer traceable unless introduced back into the read area.
