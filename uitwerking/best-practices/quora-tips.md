### Tip van ****[Kristi Anderson](https://www.quora.com/profile/Kristi-Anderson-3), Director of Operations - Scanalytics Inc.

One of the biggest issues we've discovered with kiosks is that the user is typically "**piggy-backing**" off of another users session. People typically aren't closing out after using the display, so when a new visitor approaches, they continue through the previous "experience".

My company, Scanalytics Inc. measures foot traffic via smart "floor sensors" for consumer behavior analytics. Our sensors can integrate with digital displays to react in real-time to improve the user experience.
